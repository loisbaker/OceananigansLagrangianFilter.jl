Keyword arguments
=================

  - `grid`: (required) The resolution and discrete geometry on which the `model` is solved. The
            architecture (CPU/GPU) that the model is solved on is inferred from the architecture
            of the `grid`. Note that the grid needs to be regularly spaced in the horizontal
            dimensions, ``x`` and ``y``.
  - `advection`: The scheme that advects velocities and tracers. See `Oceananigans.Advection`.
  - `forcing`: `NamedTuple` of user-defined forcing functions that contribute to solution tendencies.
  - `closure`: The turbulence closure for `model`. See `Oceananigans.TurbulenceClosures`.
  - `boundary_conditions`: `NamedTuple` containing field boundary conditions.
  - `tracers`: A tuple of symbols defining the names of the modeled tracers, or a `NamedTuple` of
               preallocated `CenterField`s.
  - `timestepper`: A symbol that specifies the time-stepping method. Either `:QuasiAdamsBashforth2` or
                   `:RungeKutta3` (default).
  - `buoyancy`: Defunct buoyancy, always nothing. Kept for integration with extensions. Default: `nothing`.
  - `velocities`: The model velocities. Default: `nothing`.
  - `diffusivity_fields`: Diffusivity fields. Default: `nothing`.
  - `auxiliary_fields`: `NamedTuple` of auxiliary fields. Default: `nothing`
