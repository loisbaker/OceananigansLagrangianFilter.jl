filter smudges the tracer field as it is advected by the inertial oscillations. The Lagrangian means directly calculated by this method are identical to the raw fields for the tracer and buoyancy shown, as they are conservative fields. However, when we remap to a mean reference position, we see the value of the Lagrangian filter in effectively removing the oscillations while preserving the tracer structures. In comparison to the offline filtering example, the online filter does a slightly worse job removing the oscillations in the 'Lagrangian filtered at mean' field, since the filter is a more optimal low-pass.","category":"page"},{"location":"literated/online_filter_geostrophic_adjustment/","page":"Geostrophic adjustment online","title":"Geostrophic adjustment online","text":"Then the velocity into the page, v:","category":"page"},{"location":"literated/online_filter_geostrophic_adjustment/","page":"Geostrophic adjustment online","title":"Geostrophic adjustment online","text":"timeseries1 = FieldTimeSeries(filter_config.output_filename, \"v\")\ntimeseries2 = FieldTimeSeries(filter_config.output_filename, \"v_Eulerian_filtered\")\ntimeseries3 = FieldTimeSeries(filter_config.output_filename, \"v_Lagrangian_filtered\")\ntimeseries4 = FieldTimeSeries(filter_config.output_filename, \"v_Lagrangian_filtered_at_mean\")\n\ntimes = timeseries1.times\n\nset_theme!(Theme(fontsize = 20))\nfig = Figure(size = (1300, 500))\n\naxis_kwargs = (xlabel = \"x\",\n               ylabel = \"z\",\n               limits = ((-5000, 5000), (-100, 0)),\n               aspect = AxisAspect(1))\n\nax1 = Axis(fig[2, 1]; title = \"Raw\", axis_kwargs...)\nax2 = Axis(fig[2, 2]; title = \"Eulerian filtered\", axis_kwargs...)\nax3 = Axis(fig[2, 3]; title = \"Lagrangian filtered\", axis_kwargs...)\nax4 = Axis(fig[2, 4]; title = \"Lagrangian filtered \\n at mean position\", axis_kwargs...)\n\n\nn = Observable(1)\nObservable(1)\n\nvar1 = @lift timeseries1[$n]\nvar2 = @lift timeseries2[$n]\nvar3 = @lift timeseries3[$n]\nvar4 = @lift timeseries4[$n]\n\nheatmap!(ax1, var1; colormap = :balance, colorrange = (-0.05, 0.05))\nheatmap!(ax2, var2; colormap = :balance, colorrange = (-0.05, 0.05))\nheatmap!(ax3, var3; colormap = :balance, colorrange = (-0.05, 0.05))\nheatmap!(ax4, var4; colormap = :balance, colorrange = (-0.05, 0.05))\n\n\ntitle = @lift \"Velocity v, time = \" * string(round(times[$n]./3600., digits=2)) * \" hours\"\nLabel(fig[1, 1:4], title, fontsize=24, tellwidth=false)\n\nfig\n\nframes = 1:length(times)\n\n@info \"Making an animation\"\n\nCairoMakie.record(fig, \"geostrophic_adjustment_filtered_v_movie_online.mp4\", frames, framerate=24) do i\n    n[] = i\nend","category":"page"},{"location":"literated/online_filter_geostrophic_adjustment/","page":"Geostrophic adjustment online","title":"Geostrophic adjustment online","text":"\"geostrophic_adjustment_filtered_v_movie_online.mp4\"","category":"page"},{"location":"literated/online_filter_geostrophic_adjustment/","page":"Geostrophic adjustment online","title":"Geostrophic adjustment online","text":"(Image: )","category":"page"},{"location":"literated/online_filter_geostrophic_adjustment/","page":"Geostrophic adjustment online","title":"Geostrophic adjustment online","text":"In this case, the Lagrangian filtered velocity fields differ from the raw fields, as expected, since velocity is not a conservative field.","category":"page"},{"location":"literated/online_filter_geostrophic_adjustment/","page":"Geostrophic adjustment online","title":"Geostrophic adjustment online","text":"# We remove these files to keep things tidy, keep them for analysis if desired\nrm(filename_stem * \".jld2\")\nrm(filename_stem * \".nc\")","category":"page"},{"location":"literated/online_filter_geostrophic_adjustment/","page":"Geostrophic adjustment online","title":"Geostrophic adjustment online","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"literated/online_filter_geostrophic_adjustment/","page":"Geostrophic adjustment online","title":"Geostrophic adjustment online","text":"This page was generated using Literate.jl.","category":"page"},{"location":"offline_filtering/choosing_offline_filters/#Choosing-offline-filters","page":"Choosing offline filters","title":"Choosing offline filters","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"offline_filtering/choosing_offline_filters/","page":"Choosing offline filters","title":"Choosing offline filters","text":"To be added.
