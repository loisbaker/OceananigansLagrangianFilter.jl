# # Geostrophic adjustment in 3D with offline Lagrangian filtering

# We set up a geostrophic adjustment problem similar to Blumen (2000), JPO
# in a domain that is horizontally periodic. We include a few gridpoints in the along-front
# direction (y) to demonstrate 3D capability.

# An initially unbalanced two-dimensional
# front oscillates with the inertial frequency around a state of geostrophic balance,
# and we illustrate that we can remove the oscillations to find the mean state.
# Credit to Tom Cummings for work on this example. 

# In this example, the filtering is performed offline after the simulation.
